Creating this 3D scene project was definitely benefial due to the offer of practical applications of theoretical understanding of computational graphics and visualization for this assignment. I gained more insights about rendering, modeling, and scene compositions during the design and development process if iterative design and development. I also had essential personal attributes combined with precise problem-solving skills, critical thinking capacities and efficient organizational capabilities for a project. 

Optimization of the rendering, as an instance, or repairing monstrous bugs, teaching patience and perseverance were some of the hard parts I worked for. The successful completion of this project has been a source of assertiveness in regard to my capacity to confront very technical issues and solve them using computational thinking in artistic projects. The successful completion of this project has been a source of assertiveness in regard based on the very technical issues I developed and solve them using computational thinking in artistic projects.

This conclusion wraps up the reflection effectively by summarizing the overall experience based on how rich is the description of a project along with discussing its significance in the context of ultilizing theoretical concepts and emphasizing key takeaways as it highlights growth of important skills like problem solving, critical thinking, project planning and management. According to the reflection of challenges and growth, it pays attention to the hard parts I experienced and how it somehow impacted an individualâ€™s character and career. While looking forwards, it contains passion for more experience on the topic in detail of 3D graphics and visualization.
